current project in pygame. not much going on in it at the moment. It's pretty much just to play around with pygame and see what I can do with it. 
It's pretty messy in it's current state, and there's a lot of refactoring that needs to be done, but it works. 

*All of the images are just placeholders I quickly made so I could test what I was doing, I'm not actually that shit. 

controls are wasd for movement, esc for pause, and i for inventory. 

there's also a map editor. 

I made exes since i figure you might not have python and pygame installed.
